                    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree
                    to the collection and use of information in relation to this

                    I will not use or share your

                    For the implementation of the speech recognition feature,
                    the application gathers voice information. The gathered data
                    is sent to Google to provide speech recognition service.
                    The gathered voice recording is converted to text by Google
                    and the resulting text is translated to Pig Latin by the 
                    application. The gathered data is not permanently stored in
                    any way by the application.
                  </p> <p>
                    The app does use third party services that may collect
                    information used to identify you.

                    I may employ third-party companies
                    and individuals due to the following reasons:

                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                    not to disclose or use the information for any other
                    purpose.
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                    I value your trust in providing us
                    your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
